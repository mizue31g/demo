# Track Specification: Translate all application output to Japanese

## Goal
The primary goal of this track is to localize all user-facing text and dynamic content generated by the Patient Handoff AI Assistant into Japanese. This will ensure that Japanese-speaking healthcare professionals can use the application effectively and intuitively, aligning with the "Professional and Clinical" tone and "Modern and Minimalist" visual identity.

## Scope
This includes, but is not limited to:
- All static UI text (labels, buttons, headers, messages).
- Dynamic content generated by the AI assistant (e.g., patient summaries, handover notes).
- Error messages, loading indicators, and informational pop-ups.
- Any textual output from API calls that is directly presented to the user.

## Non-Goals
- Translation of developer-facing content (e.g., logs, internal comments).
- Localization of numerical formats, dates, or currencies (unless explicitly required by the translation strategy).
- Full internationalization (i18n) support for multiple languages beyond Japanese in this initial phase.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The application must display all user-facing text in Japanese when the Japanese locale is active.
- Dynamic content generated by the Vertex AI API must be translated into Japanese before display.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The translation process should not introduce significant latency into the user experience.
- **Accuracy:** Translated content must be clinically accurate and culturally appropriate for Japanese healthcare professionals.
- **Maintainability:** The chosen translation solution should be easily maintainable and scalable for future updates or additional languages.

## Technical Considerations

### Translation Strategy
- Investigate and select an appropriate method for managing translations (e.g., using an i18n library, a dedicated translation service, or direct string management).
- For AI-generated content, consider integration with translation APIs (if Vertex AI doesn't directly support Japanese output or if further refinement is needed).

### UI/UX Impact
- Ensure that translated text fits within the existing UI layout without causing overflow or visual inconsistencies.
- Review fonts and typography to ensure proper rendering of Japanese characters.
